I sense a soul in search of an answer!  

I am a Researcher at [National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)](https://astrec.nict.go.jp/en/), under the direction of [Masao Utiyama](https://att-astrec.nict.go.jp/member/mutiyama/index.html), an Adjunct Faculty in IIT Madras, working alongside [Prof Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) and [Dr Anoop Kunchukuttan](http://anoopk.in/) of [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.org/), and an incoming visiting Assistant Professor in IIT Bombay working alongside [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/). I work on efficient multilingual understanding and generation for low-resource languages, especially Indic and, more recently, Creole languages.

I completed my Ph.D. in Informatics from Kyoto University, Japan under the supervision of [Prof. Sadao Kurohashi](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/director/) (currently director general of NII, Japan), M.Tech. in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, India under the supervision of [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) (ex-director of IIT Patna) and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Mumbai](https://www.sfit.ac.in/), India. In the past, I was an intern at Google, Japan in the Rosetta team (Google Translate) headed by [Dr. Hideto Kazawa](https://research.google/people/hideto-kazawa/).

In NICT, I focus on low-resource Machine Translation (MT) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), while working with an awesome team of international researchers. I also collaborate with Dr [Sheng Li](https://halspeech.github.io/) of the [Speech Lab in NICT](https://ast-astrec.nict.go.jp/en/). At AI4Bharat and CFILT, I am mainly involved in mentoring students on their research focusing on MT and Evaluation, NLG and, more recently, pragmatics and model robustness. Now that I am an adjunct faculty I hope to offer a course or two on Generative AI someday soon. I am one of the co-creators of [IndicBART](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indic-bart), [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2), [Airavata](https://ai4bharat.github.io/airavata/), [YANMTT](https://github.com/prajdabre/yanmtt) and [Whisper-Streaming](https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming). I also have a (Japanese) patent on [flexible decoding of generative models](https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7297286B2/ja). I have recently started consulting in my free time so please feel free to contact me (see [here](https://prajdabre.github.io/consulting) for details).

I have been a reviewer/committee member since 2012 for venues such as ACL, NAACL, IJCAI, EMNLP, CoNLL, WMT, WAT, MT Summit, IJCNLP, ALR, TALLIP, TASLP, CSUR and CSL and an area chair for ACL, NAACL, EMNLP and EACL since 2022. I am also an organizer of the [Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT)](https://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/WAT/) since 2018 and of the [M3Oriental workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/m3oriental) since 2023. Long ago, in 2012, I was one of the local organizers of COLING 2012.

I love astronomy, reading books (history, sci-fi and evolution), video games (Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch) and I am a big time anime and manga fan. I speak English, Hindi, Marathi and Japanese.
