I sense a soul in search of an answer!  

I am a Senior Research Scientist at Googe Research Australia working on Gemini alongside [Trevor Cohn](https://trevorcohn.github.io/) and [Grace Chung](https://au.linkedin.com/in/grace-chung-1420782). I am also an Adjunct Faculty in IIT Madras, working alongside [Prof Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/) and [Dr Anoop Kunchukuttan](http://anoopk.in/) of [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.org/), and a visiting Assistant Professor in IIT Bombay (worked alongside the late [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/)). My work focuses on LLM post-training, reinforcement learning, multilingualism, machine and speech translation, efficiency, low-resource languages, especially Indic and, more recently, Creole languages and dialects.

Prior to this, I was a Researcher at [National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)](https://astrec.nict.go.jp/en/), under the direction of [Masao Utiyama](https://att-astrec.nict.go.jp/member/mutiyama/index.html). I completed my Ph.D. in Informatics from Kyoto University, Japan under the supervision of [Prof. Sadao Kurohashi](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/faculty/director/) (currently director general of NII, Japan), M.Tech. in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, India under the supervision of the late [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) (ex-director of IIT Patna) and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Mumbai](https://www.sfit.ac.in/), India. In the past, I was an intern at Google, Japan in the Rosetta team (Google Translate) headed by [Dr. Hideto Kazawa](https://research.google/people/hideto-kazawa/).

In NICT, I focused on low-resource Machine Translation (MT) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), while working with an awesome team of international researchers. Back then I collaborated with Dr [Sheng Li](https://halspeech.github.io/) of the [Speech Lab in NICT](https://ast-astrec.nict.go.jp/en/). At AI4Bharat and CFILT, I am mainly involved in mentoring students on their research focusing on MT and Evaluation, NLG and, more recently, pragmatics and model robustness. I am one of the co-creators of [IndicBART](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/indic-bart), [IndicTrans2](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicTrans2), [Airavata](https://ai4bharat.github.io/airavata/), [YANMTT](https://github.com/prajdabre/yanmtt) and [Whisper-Streaming](https://github.com/ufal/whisper_streaming). I also have a (Japanese) patent on [flexible decoding of generative models](https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7297286B2/ja).

I have been a reviewer/committee member since 2012 for venues such as ACL, NAACL, IJCAI, EMNLP, CoNLL, WMT, WAT, MT Summit, IJCNLP, ALR, TALLIP, TASLP, CSUR and CSL and an area chair for ACL, NAACL, EMNLP and EACL since 2022. I was also a senior area chair for ACL 2025. I am also an organizer of the [Workshop on Asian Translation (WAT)](https://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/WAT/) since 2018 and of the [M3Oriental workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/m3oriental) since 2023. Long ago, in 2012, I was one of the local organizers of COLING 2012.

I love astronomy, reading books (history, sci-fi and evolution), video games (Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch) and I am a big time anime and manga fan. I speak English, Hindi, Marathi and Japanese.

I have recently started consulting in my free time so please contact me on my personal email (see [here](https://prajdabre.github.io/consulting) for details).
